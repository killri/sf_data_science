### Project discription
We are trying a guess a number generated by a computer by minimum attempts

### What case are we solving?
We want to white a programm that guesses a generated number by minimum attempts

**Conditions of the competition**
- Computer is generating an integer number from 1 to 100. We must guess it. By 'guess' we mean that we must write a programm that guesses the number/
- The algorithm gets the information on begger o lower the generated number in comparison with his current attempt

**Quality metrics**

The results are estimated by the mean attepts count of the algirithm in 1000 repetitions

**What are we practicing?**

- We are learning to use basic coding environment (VS Code / GitHub / etc.)
- We are practicing making a good=readable python code

### Brief data information
No specific data. Just the case.

### Project work steps
1. [Making a game where a human tries to guess the number genetared bu computer](________)
2.  [Random algirithm implementation and it's efficiency estimation](________)
3. [----](________)

### Result
Still researching

### Conclusions
Still researching

Need time to learn new programms and environments...
