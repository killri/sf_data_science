### Project discription
We are trying a guess a number generated by a computer by minimum attempts.
The task is to create an algorithm that needs less then 20 attempts.

### What case are we solving?
We want to white a programm that guesses a generated number by minimum attempts

*Conditions of the competition*
- Computer is generating an integer number from 1 to 100. We must guess it. By 'guess' we mean that we must write a programm that guesses the number
- The algorithm gets the information on begger o lower the generated number in comparison with his current attempt

*Quality metrics*

The results are estimated by the mean attepts count of the algirithm in 1000 repetitions

*What are we practicing?*

- We are learning to use basic coding environment (VS Code / GitHub / etc.)
- We are practicing making a good=readable python code

### Brief data information
No specific data. Just the case.

### Project work steps
1. Making a game where a human tries to guess the number generated by computer
2. Random algorithm implementation and it's efficiency estimation
3. Dividing by 2 algorithm realisation

### Result
The final algorithm guesses the number by 5 attempts on avarage. Maximum attempt count is 7.
The result is expected becouse 2 in degree if 7 > 100.

The algorithm code is in 'min_attempts_guess_alg.py' file

The jupiter presentation is in 'min_attempts_guess_alg.ipynb' file

### Conclusions
The task is done. 7 attempts is less the 20.
